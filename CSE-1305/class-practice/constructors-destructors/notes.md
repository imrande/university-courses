**Constructor** <br>
<p>Constructor is a special member function which automatically initializes all the
data members of an object at the moment object is created...</p>

<p>**4 Types of Constructor**</p>
<p>Default Constructor</p>
<p>Parameterized Constructor</p>
<p>Constructor with Default Value</p>
<p>Copy Constructor</p>

**Default Constructor** <br>
<p>Constructor without any arguments is known as Default Constructor. Constructor is
automatically called when the object is created for that class..</p>

**Parameterized Constructor** <br>
<p>Constructor which accepts arguments is known as Parameterized Constructor...</p>

**Constructor with default arguments** <br>
<p>It is a special case of parameterized constructor where each arguments is assigned
with a default value. So, if the user passes all arguments during the object declaration time, system uses those values. If the user not passes less/no arguments during the
object declaration time, system uses default arguments for missing parameters...</p>

**copy Constructor** <br>
<p>A constructor which accepts reference of an object as its parameter is known as copy
constructor...</p>

**Constructor Overloading** <br>
<p>A class may contain more than one constructor, the concept is known as Constructor
Overloading...</p>

**Calling Constructor Explicitly** <br>
<p> 2 Ways we can call constructor explicitly </p>
<p> 1) like a normal function [Sample()]</p>
<p> 2) using class and its object with Scope resolution operator (::)
[s1.Sample::Sample()]</p>

__Destructor__ <br>
<p>Destructor is a special member function which destroys the object once its
requirement is complete. It is done to release the memory space occupied by the object so that release memory can be used in some other purpose...</p>
