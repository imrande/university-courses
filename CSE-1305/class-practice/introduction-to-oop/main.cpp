  Programming Paradigms —
  1) Monolithic Programming — Basic, Assembly
  2) Procedural Programming — Fortana, Cobol
  3) Structured Programming — c
  4) Object-Oriented Programming — C++, Java
  5) Functional Programming — Haskel, julia
  6) Aspect-Oriented Programming

  Key Concepts of OOP
  1) Class — A Class is a collection of objects which has identical properties and
  common behaviour...

  2) Object — An object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviours.
   An object is an instance of a class. WHen a class is declared no memory is allocated
  but when the class is instantiated memory is allocated..

  3) Abstraction — Data Abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature
  in object-Oriented Programming. Abstraction means showing the essential information and
  hiding the details. Data Abstraction refers to providing only essential information
  about the data to the outside world and hiding the background info...

  4) Inheritance — Inheritance is a feature of OOP that allow to code reuseabilty
  when a class includes property of another class. Considering HumanBeing is a class
  which has attribute hands, legs, eyes, and functions like eat, sleep, walk etc

  5) Polymorphism — The word Polymorphism means having many forms. We can say that 
  Polymorphism as the ability of message to be displayed in more than one form...

  6) Encapsulation — Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by
  restricting access to public methods. Instance variables are kept private and
  accessor methods are made public to achieve this.
