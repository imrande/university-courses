/*
Polymorphism Hierarchy
1) Compile time Polymorphism
  1) function overloading
  2) operator overloading
2) Run time Polymorphism
  1) virtual environment

*) Rules of function overloading
1) The function overloading can be differentiated in terms of arguments type
2) In case, if arguments type is same then fn overloading can be differentiated in terms of
numbers of arguments
3) In case, If both type and number of arguments are same then fn overloading can be
differentiated in terms of changing the arguments position
4) If none of the above 3 rules are matched then fn can't be overloaded
