// State the operation of logical short circuit operator in Java.

when the first argument of AND(&&) function evaluates to false, the overall value must
be false

when the first argument of OR(||) function evaluates to true, the overall value must
be true

In case of short-circuit logical operators (&&, ||), if the left expression is false, the right
side expression is not evaluated. But in case of single-character logical operators, all the
expressions are evaluated.
