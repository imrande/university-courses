// Differentiate among instance variable, class variable and local variable.

local variable ==>
local variable is declared inside a method or arguments of methods

class variable ==>
class variable is declared with static modifier. It tells the compiler that there is
exactly one copy variable regardless how many times class has been Instantiated

instance variable ==>
An instance variable is declared without static modifier. It is called instance variable
because its value is unique to each instance of the class
